## No activation fee

There is no charge or fee to activate your L2 account on ZKEX.



## No deposit fees

There are no fees for depositing money - but you may need to pay a 'gas fee' to the blockchain you're sending assets from.



## Gas fees

The 'gas fee' is a charge from the L1 chain when you move funds to/from L1 (on-chain) <> L2 (off-chain), which can vary depending on network congestion.

There are no gas fees once you are trading on L2.



## Trading fees

The fee structure has not yet been confirmed, and will be released before mainnet launch.
