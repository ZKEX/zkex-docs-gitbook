# 🎟️ ZKEX Account

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to trade on ZKEX, users need to deposit their funds from the original L1 chain or L2 rollup (e.g. Ethererum, Polygon, zkSync etc.) to their account on ZKEX. The original assets are locked by ZKEX’s smart contract on the original chain, and equivalent funds released for trading on the ZKEX dApp.

Since all deposits, transactions, and withdrawals are secured with zero-knowledge proofs, this allows assets to be used safely on the ZKEX dApp, while still ensuring security at the same level as the original chain.
{% endhint %}

## Deposits

Depositing into your Account is simple. The user selects the supported chain where their assets are, then selects a token amount to lock those funds into the ZKEX smart contract.

There is no charge for a deposit, other than any gas fees incurred from the originating chain.



## Withdrawals

There are currently two ways to withdraw assets from a user's ZKEX’s Account, with different speeds and costs.

Withdrawals incur both a fee and gas fees to the destination chain.

> #### Fast Withdrawal
>
> ZKEX offers a fast withdraw option, which allows users to withdraw assets from your Account via a broker. The broker will take a fee based on the required amount, and send the funds quickly. Fast withdrawals are still completed on-chain, but using a broker bypasses the normal transaction time taken with a standard withdraw.

> #### Standard Withdrawal
>
> Standard withdrawal times depend on the level of trading activity on the dApp. They can be as fast as an hour, but could take upto 24 hours.
