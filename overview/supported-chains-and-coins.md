## Stablecoins

Stablecoins are a cryptocurrency pegged to a target value such as the US Dollar at a 1:1 ratio.

Users can deposit any of the following fiat-backed stablecoins, which are merged to a unified 'USD' equivalent in a user's ZKEX wallet:

* USDC
* USDT

Since all deposited stablecoins are equivalent to USD, the number of trading pairs is minimized, making it simpler to trade.
